# My PokéLibrary

### Description of Project

The project I intend to design this term is a *Pokémon* collection organizer  
and deck builder, it will allow users, whether it be collectors, trading card  
game players, or casual fans, to document their *Pokémon* cards digitally so  
that they won't need to go through their entire card collection by hand. It will  
also allow users to sort and categorize their cards by things like rarity, type,  
and evolution stage. The project will also have a deck builder feature where  
users can also build their own custom decks with cards they have in their  
collection. The deck builder feature will also make sure that the decks they  
build, are within the official *Pokémon Trading Card Game* rules and  
regulations. 

This project is of relevance to me as I consider myself a casual *Pokémon*  
card collector and I often find myself going through my collection by hand  
to find certain cards, or document the quantity of certain types I own; having  
an application that helps me keep track of my cards allows me to both save  
time when sorting my cards, and helps keep my cards in good condition as  
I rummage through them less.
